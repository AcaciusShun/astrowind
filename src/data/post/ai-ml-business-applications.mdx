# AI & Machine Learning in Business: From Concept to Implementation

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are no longer futuristic conceptsâ€”they're practical business tools delivering real value today. At Somincola, we help organizations harness the power of AI/ML to solve complex challenges and create competitive advantages.

## Understanding AI vs Machine Learning

### Artificial Intelligence

AI is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider "smart" or "intelligent."

### Machine Learning

ML is a subset of AI that enables machines to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Business Applications of AI/ML
